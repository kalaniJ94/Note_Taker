## Description

THis challenge was a definite, well, challenge! I knew going in that I didn't know routing all that well quite yet, and this was an excellent opportunity to brush up all of those skills. I feel much more confident with those skills now, particularly as they relate to interacting with a JSON database. It was also an exercise in error troubleshooting, alot of time was spent hunting down answers via technical documents and stack overflow.

## Installation

1. Upon opening the app, check to make sure you have a package.json file on the lefthand side. If not, open the terminal and type "npm init -y".
2. Still in the terminal, type " npm i". This will install all necessary node packages. Check to make sure your dependencies list matches this: "dependencies":  "express": "^4.16.4",
    "uuid": "^3.4.0"
